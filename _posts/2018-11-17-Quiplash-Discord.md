title: Quiplash Discord bot
---

Over the past few days, I have made a Discord bot for the Jackbox.tv game Quiplash. The GitHub repository is at [https://github.com/Landmaster/quiplash-discord](https://github.com/Landmaster/quiplash-discord).

It currently runs on my own computer, but I may try to get a Raspberry Pi to run it even when I am taking my computer elsewhere.

title: How the Landmaster came to be
---

Some of you may wonder why I go by [@Landmaster](https://github.com/Landmaster) on GitHub. The story goes back to the summer of 2015, during band camp…and **no, this has *nothing* to do with the Landmaster of Star Fox…**

At the start of one of the days of band camp (the 2<sup>nd</sup> Tuesday, if I recall correctly),
there was writing on the whiteboard, above my band director, that read “**LORD *[insert band director’s name here]¹* OF DUNANS.**”
Wondering why that was there, I quickly found out that my band director had been given *a single square foot*
of land in Dunans (not that that means anything). My fellow band members and I found that quite amusing;
we started occasionally referring to him as the “lord of Dunans,” and it stuck—at least in my head. When I created my
GitHub account in July of 2016, I was thinking of a GitHub name in a similar vein to the “lord of Dunans,”
only stronger and more general…

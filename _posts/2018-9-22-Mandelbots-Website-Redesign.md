title: Redesigning the Mandelbots Website
---
Besides being the creator of PlusTiC, I am also a recent member of the Mandelbots, the local robotics team. I am currently
in charge of [the Mandelbots website](http://mandelbots.github.io/) after the old website maintainer left the Mandelbots
in a deep internal schism between him and the previous leader. I have posted the details of the website redesign
[here](http://mandelbots.github.io/blog.html#blogWebsiteRedesign), and you can follow its developent
[on its GitHub page](https://github.com/mandelbots/mandelbots.github.io).

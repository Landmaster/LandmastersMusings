I just wanted to share with you guys a wonderful Christmas medley by Two Steps From Hell:

In case you don’t know what Two Steps From Hell (TSFH) is, it is a musical group founded by Thomas Bergersen and Nick Phoenix that makes awesomely epic pieces, such as *Impossible*, *Victory*, and *Children of the Sun*.
Notwithstanding the fact that most of my family and friends have never heard of TSFH before, my music library comprises a full house of TSFH songs which I listen to regularly. TSFH’s music is quite uplifting, giving me hope
when times are tough.

Anyhoo, Merry Christmas to all!

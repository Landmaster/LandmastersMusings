title: 1,000,000 Downloads of PlusTiC
---

I started PlusTiC back in December 2016, when I was just learning to use the Forge modding API. A novice at the time, I mainly used it to experiment with new Tinkers Construct materials (I especially wanted materials for the Biomes o' Plenty and Mekanism mods), and I did not release PlusTiC to the public until February 11. I did not expect the mod to become as popular as it is now, having reached over 1,000,000 downloads today on CurseForge!

A big thanks goes to everyone who has downloaded my mod over the months!
